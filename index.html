  <h1>The Story</h1>
    <div class="article">
      <p>January 1974. Jay Brothers boldly opens the doors of his namesake ad
shop in the face of a wheezing economy. Our founder could not have
foreseen the iconic brands that would one day cross that very threshold.
Forty years later, nearly 100 of us in Tulsa, Oklahoma City and Wichita
count ourselves fortunate to be part of “the agency Jay built.” </p>
      <p>The blueprint he passed on to Paul – his son and our leader – remains.
Creative, intentional advertising coupled with a servant’s heart.
It propels us forward, sometimes by feet and yards, occasionally by
hold-on-to-your-hat miles. We do not take our trajectory lightly.
Daily victories are celebrated with 3-pointer enthusiasm.</p>

      <p class=lightgray>Forty years is a foundation. A launching pad. Equal parts sage wisdom
and youthful energy. It whispers with a wink, “The future isn’t to be
feared, it’s to be mastered.”</p>
